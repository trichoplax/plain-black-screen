# Plain black screen
Hide OS clutter, to avoid distraction and screen burn.

## Usage
- Open [the HTML page](https://trichoplax.github.io/plain-black-screen) in a separate browser window.
- Set the HTML page to display full screen (for example, by pressing F11).
- Switch to other windows to use them with no operating system clutter.

Works best with windows that are smaller than the screen, such as tiled windows. May not work with a single maximised window.

You can also save the HTML page locally if you want to remove the need for an internet connection.

## How it works
It's just a plain black page.

## Development
Feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/trichoplax/plain-black-screen/issues) if you find a bug. The codebase is small and maintainable.
