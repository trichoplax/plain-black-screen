# Plain black screen
Hide OS clutter, to avoid distraction and screen burn

## Usage
- Open [the HTML page](https://trichoplax.github.io/plain-black-screen) in a separate browser window.
- Set the page to display full screen (for example, by pressing F11).
- Switch to other windows to use them with no operating system clutter.

You can also save the HTML page locally if you want to remove the need for an internet connection.

## How it works
It's just a plain black page.
